      <b>BEWARE</b>
      <p>
        This serves as a little trinket collection of projects, interests, and samples of writing - in a futile attempt to bring back the old internet. This means a lot of my site is more like a minoan labyrinth than a neat, clean minimalistic site!

        <h3>Colophon</h3>
        <p className="prose">
          This site has been made via a mixture of a massive amount of techniques - some visible, others less so.
          <br></br>
          The bulk of the site is React and Next.js, especially for the nicer filtering. Sanity is my CRM of choice,
          as it's the only current CRM that let's me do way too much. 3D models are linked as references, and converted
          to a gltf format to allow fast rendering. Tailwindcss sits as a nice UI element, with a frankestein mixture of javascript and css.
          <br></br>
          Future Current Integration: React Flow showcasing links between projects. 3D library of uses. 
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <b>AI Use</b>
        <p className="prose">
          I love to be clear about the use of AI, as I value and love using the technology slightly responsibly. All my writing
          is my own. I usually hate the way AI writes for creative endevours, so I usually don't use it for those. 
          <br></br><br></br>
          My code ends up being a mixture of the two, I tend to guide an AI in quite specific ways related to aspects like smoother animations, better styling improvements for things like mirror finishes. 
          I'm not afraid to use more modern techniques like multi-agent workflows when designing concept projects, but any "vibe coded" snippets/projects will be clearly marked.
